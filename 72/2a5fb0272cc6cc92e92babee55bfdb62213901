The failures in the extra packages happen because we pull a version of Twig as dependency that does not include my changes. How do we deal with this kind of failure on this repo?

@derrabus accept it for now, as it will be resolved after the merge-up in the 4.x branch.

Having PHPUnit 11 support only in 4.0 sounds good to me.
