fabbot failure is on an existing line - so leaving that alone

Symfony UX supports Twig 2.x, so maybe we should fix this on 2.x instead?

@weaverryan we hit this bug this morning when upgrading an app (which uses UX) to Symfony 6.3. We call `$twig->addGlobal()` in a listener and we saw the error message _"Unable to add global "foobar" as the runtime or the extensions have already been initialized."_.

It was really tricky to debug this ... but Nicolas point me to here ðŸ™Œ  So, thanks for taking care of this.
