@stof thanks for the review, can you please help me out and check the failing builds here?
https://github.com/OskarStark/Twig/pull/1

I don't know the difference between travis and my setup, I tried to install `intl` extension, but this seems to be not needed, as `symfony/intl` is required by `extra/intl-extra` ðŸ¤”

Thanks

The `symfony/intl` polyfill always formats using the `en` locale. so tests relying on other locales for their assertions will fail if you run them against the polyfill rather than the extension.
The polyfill is meant to allow writing code supporting intl and then running it without `ext-intl` if you only care about `en`. but if you do care about internationalization, you need to actual extension. Making a full polyfill in `symfony/polyfill` would require bundle the CLDR data, which was considered out of scope as `ext-intl` will provide better performance.

If I understand it right, I need to install the `intl` extension to fix it, but it didn't help, lets see again...
