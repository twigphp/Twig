This PR was auto-closed because I've removed the master branch and this PR was based on master. I cannot reopen it unfortunately.

Changing the base branch to 2.x worked :)

@fabpot there is a reason why this PR hasn't been merged? I ask because I was doing the same PR

@willrowe Can you rebase on current 2.x and add a note in the CHANGELOG file before I merge? Thank you.

Sure, I can do that at some point this week. Thanks for taking a look at this!
