String Extension
================

This package is a Twig extension that provides integration with the Symfony
String component.

It provides a [`u`][1] filter that wraps a text in a `UnicodeString`
object to give access to [methods of the class][2].

It also provides a [`slug`][3] filter which is simply a wrapper for the 
[`AsciiSlugger`][4]'s `slug` method.
