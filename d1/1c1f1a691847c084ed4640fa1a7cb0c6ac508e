A template cannot be reloaded inside the same PHP process (as the compiled template is already loaded in memory). So your use case where you render the template, then edit the file and then render it again will *never* work, even without any load.

For the `twig_test_read.php` case, this indeed comes from the precision of the mtime (the template is modified too soon after the cache generation so the timestamp is the same)

I understand this is not a bug, it's a feature (removed this part from the code)

A bug occurs just in twig_test_read.php and to fix it I propose this patch.

I understand why this happens. And this patch corrected this error.
