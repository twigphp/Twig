Deprecated Features
===================

This document lists deprecated features in Twig 2.x. Deprecated features are
kept for backward compatibility and removed in the next major release (a
feature that was deprecated in Twig 2.x is removed in Twig 3.0).

Filters
-------

* As of Twig 2.x, the ``Twig_SimpleFilter`` class is deprecated and will be
  removed in Twig 3.x (use ``Twig_Filter`` instead). In Twig 2.x,
  ``Twig_SimpleFilter`` is just an alias for ``Twig_Filter``.

Functions
---------

* As of Twig 2.x, the ``Twig_SimpleFunction`` class is deprecated and will be
  removed in Twig 3.x (use ``Twig_Function`` instead). In Twig 2.x,
  ``Twig_SimpleFunction`` is just an alias for ``Twig_Function``.

Tests
-----

* As of Twig 2.x, the ``Twig_SimpleTest`` class is deprecated and will be
  removed in Twig 3.x (use ``Twig_Test`` instead). In Twig 2.x,
  ``Twig_SimpleTest`` is just an alias for ``Twig_Test``.
