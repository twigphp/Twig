I suggest also adding the `@return` phpdoc in 3.x

I can change the PR, target v3, and then start applying `@return` types. Then in v4 we can (or not) change them to native types.

@ruudk I would change them to native type in v4 (as done for the Twig public API)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, then we start with this PR for v4. When it's merged, I'll continue for v3 with `@return` tags, and then later the native types in v4 again.

Let's start with v3, it makes things easier for me and more logical.

Alright done. Targeting v3 and rebased.

~After this is merged, I will do a slightly bigger PR that changes a few more places in one go.~

Made some changes. Turns out that we need to add the missing type hints to the `abstract Template`.

Next to that, we now also type the 2 properties in the compiled templates.

I applied the feedback. I added more return types, since the `Template` class is `@internal` anyway.

What do you think?

Applied the changes.
