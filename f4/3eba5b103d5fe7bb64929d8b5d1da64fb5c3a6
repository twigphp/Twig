`boolean` is a valid PHPStan type, but `number` is not.
See https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types

Can we maybe update the example, to not use a `number` instead?

[TwigStan](https://github.com/twigstan/twigstan) will only accept PHPStan types, as it's a PHPStan analyzer.

Making this `types` tag too strict up front, only limits its usage in the wild.

The documentation is not up to date. PHPStan _does_ properly understand `number` ðŸŽ‰
I'll fix the docs.

Do you think it's worth it to update TypesTest.php and TypesTokenParser.php ?
