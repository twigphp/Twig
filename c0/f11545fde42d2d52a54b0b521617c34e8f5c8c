you could check that `getFunctions` or `getFilters` is not called on a registered extension as a way to detect that the initialization is not performed (which also does not require mocking the Environment AFAIK).

I tried your suggestion:

```php
$twig = new Environment($loader, $options);
$extension = $this->createMock(ExtensionInterface::class);
$extension->expects($this->never())->method($this->anything());
$twig->addExtension($extension);
```

With this, the test fails. My assumption is that the test guesses the cache key wrong.

Adding the extension changes the cache key. 🤦🏻‍♂️  I'll try to work around that.

I think, I've fixed the test. Thank you for your help, @stof.
