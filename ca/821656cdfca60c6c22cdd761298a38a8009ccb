What should be the base branch?

I think it should be 1.x. AFAIK, 1.x still gets minor version releases.

IIUC, it's purely related to HTML. If that's the case, I don't think it belongs to the core.

Might be more appropriate in Twig-extensions.

At least, the name should be changed to something like `css_class(es)` as suggested by @javiereguiluz in the linked issue.

For inspiration, in Craft CMS we've got a `attr()` function ([see docs](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/3.2/docs/dev/functions.md#attr)).

```twig
{% set myAttributes = {
    class: ['one', 'two'],
    disabled: true,
    readonly: false,
    data: {
        baz: 'Escape this "',
        qux: {
            some: ['data', '"quoted"']
        }
    },
    style: {
        'background-color': 'red',
        'font-size': '20px'
    },
} %}

<div {{ attr(myAttributes) }}></div>
```

For conditional classes you can use ternary notation in the array.

```twig
{% set myAttributes = {
    class: [
        'one',
        loop.last ? 'two',
    ],
} %}

<div {{ attr(myAttributes) }}></div>
```

If `class` is the only attribute you want to output.

```twig
{% set class = [
    'one',
    loop.last ? 'two',
] %}

<div {{ attr({ class: class }) }}></div>
```

Another great use case where I would love to see shorthand notation for object props become a thing in Twig. Maybe one dayâ€¦ https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/pull/3002

AFAI class are not part of CSS but of HTML and then other specs that build on top of HTML can use them (CSS class selectors and Javascript `getElementsByClassName`).

According to this I don't think we should use CSS in the name of the function.

I've rebased to current 2.x and made some minor changes. The biggest one being the move from the Core extension to the new HTML extension and the renaming to `html_classes`.
