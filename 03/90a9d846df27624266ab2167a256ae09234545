@lyrixx Can you add a test to check that we don't leak output on non-debug mode and that we have the output on debug mode? Also, can you add a note in the CHANGELOG?

@fabpot Done. That was not easy because PHPUnit buffer output + has an error handler. So the simplest thing to do was to use an external script

@lyrixx Tests do not pass for 5.4 :)

Woho, PHP 5.4. Thanks for report. I fixed that in a very clean way :joy:

Yay for PHP 5.4... but some other PHP versions are now broken :joy:

I stop using symfony/process for using plain `exec`. Simpler to manage! And now it's all green :green_heart:
I also addressed your comments.
Thanks.
