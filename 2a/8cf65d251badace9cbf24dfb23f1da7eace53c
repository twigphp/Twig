I don't understand the intl-extra failure. They look like they're failing because of data that could differ between ICU versions, but I'm not aware I have changed anything that could lead to different ICU data being loaded.

Also, I get a _different_ failure localy, but that one is at least consistent between 4.x and this branch. ðŸ˜“

Apart from that, the test suite is green. ðŸŽ‰

Could it be that the `LANG` env variable [set in the phpunit configuration](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/blob/fb2663eb69f43251ea3399e9a72101f9bb94ae5f/extra/intl-extra/phpunit.xml.dist#L13) does not work anymore to define the default ext-intl locale ?
