You may want to switch to `::class` constant for all referenced class names.
```php
    $rectorConfig->rule(\Rector\Php55\Rector\String_\StringClassNameToClassConstantRector::class);
```

We don't update 2.x anymore except for bug fixes. Can you retarget on 3.x?

Also replaced calls to `twig_test_iterable` with `is_iterable`. The function `twig_test_iterable` is deprecated to be removed in 4.0.
