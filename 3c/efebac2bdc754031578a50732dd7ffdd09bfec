Thanks for the review @stof! I believe I've addressed the comments.

Would be great to add tests

I added a simple assertion to ensure the `twig.markdown.default` definition is correct. Suggestions on additional tests? I typically use [this library](https://github.com/SymfonyTest/SymfonyDependencyInjectionTest) for these tests so I'm a bit out of my element.

I added a little note about using this feature in the docs. Anything else I can do to get this merged?

@kbond Can you have a look at the failing tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it's an indirect deprecation from `league/commonmark`. How would you like me to handle?

The best would be to fix Commonmark and make a release.
