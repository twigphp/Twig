* 0.9.6-DEV

 * fixed lexer when a template has a big chunk of text between/in a block

* 0.9.5 (2010-01-20)

As for any new release, don't forget to remove all cached templates after
upgrading.

If you have defined custom filters, you MUST upgrade them for this release. To
upgrade, replace "array" with "new Twig_Filter_Function", and replace the
environment constant by the "needs_environment" option:

  // before
  'even'   => array('twig_is_even_filter', false),
  'escape' => array('twig_escape_filter', true),

  // after
  'even'   => new Twig_Filter_Function('twig_is_even_filter'),
  'escape' => new Twig_Filter_Function('twig_escape_filter', array('needs_environment' => true)),

If you have created NodeTransformer classes, you will need to upgrade them to
the new interface (please note that the interface is not yet considered
stable).

 * fixed list nodes that did not extend the Twig_NodeListInterface
 * added the "without loop" option to the for tag (it disables the generation of the loop variable)
 * refactored node transformers to node visitors
 * fixed automatic-escaping for blocks
 * added a way to specify variables to pass to an included template
 * changed the automatic-escaping rules to be more sensible and more configurable in custom filters (the documentation lists all the rules)
 * improved the filter system to allow object methods to be used as filters
 * changed the Array and String loaders to actually make use of the cache mechanism
 * included the default filter function definitions in the extension class files directly (Core, Escaper)
 * added the // operator (like the floor() PHP function)
 * added the .. operator (as a syntactic sugar for the range filter when the step is 1)
 * added the in operator (as a syntactic sugar for the in filter)
 * added the following filters in the Core extension: in, range
 * added support for arrays (same behavior as in PHP, a mix between lists and dictionaries, arrays and hashes)
 * enhanced some error messages to provide better feedback in case of parsing errors

* 0.9.4 (2009-12-02)

If you have custom loaders, you MUST upgrade them for this release: The
Twig_Loader base class has been removed, and the Twig_LoaderInterface has also
been changed (see the source code for more information or the documentation).

 * added support for DateTime instances for the date filter
 * fixed loop.last when the array only has one item
 * made it possible to insert newlines in tag and variable blocks
 * fixed a bug when a literal '\n' were present in a template text
 * fixed bug when the filename of a template contains */
 * refactored loaders

* 0.9.3 (2009-11-11)

This release is NOT backward compatible with the previous releases.

  The loaders do not take the cache and autoReload arguments anymore. Instead,
  the Twig_Environment class has two new options: cache and auto_reload.
  Upgrading your code means changing this kind of code:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates', '/path/to/compilation_cache', true);
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader);

  to something like this:

      $loader = new Twig_Loader_Filesystem('/path/to/templates');
      $twig = new Twig_Environment($loader, array(
        'cache' => '/path/to/compilation_cache',
        'auto_reload' => true,
      ));

 * deprecated the "items" filter as it is not needed anymore
 * made cache and auto_reload options of Twig_Environment instead of arguments of Twig_Loader
 * optimized template loading speed
 * removed output when an error occurs in a template and render() is used
 * made major speed improvements for loops (up to 300% on even the smallest loops)
 * added properties as part of the sandbox mode
 * added public properties support (obj.item can now be the item property on the obj object)
 * extended set tag to support expression as value ({% set foo as 'foo' ~ 'bar' %} )
 * fixed bug when \ was used in HTML

* 0.9.2 (2009-10-29)

 * made some speed optimizations
 * changed the cache extension to .php
 * added a js escaping strategy
 * added support for short block tag
 * changed the filter tag to allow chained filters
 * made lexer more flexible as you can now change the default delimiters
 * added set tag
 * changed default directory permission when cache dir does not exist (more secure)
 * added macro support
 * changed filters first optional argument to be a Twig_Environment instance instead of a Twig_Template instance
 * made Twig_Autoloader::autoload() a static method
 * avoid writing template file if an error occurs
 * added $ escaping when outputting raw strings
 * enhanced some error messages to ease debugging
 * fixed empty cache files when the template contains an error

* 0.9.1 (2009-10-14)

  * fixed a bug in PHP 5.2.6
  * fixed numbers with one than one decimal
  * added support for method calls with arguments ({{ foo.bar('a', 43) }})
  * made small speed optimizations
  * made minor tweaks to allow better extensibility and flexibility

* 0.9.0 (2009-10-12)

 * Initial release
